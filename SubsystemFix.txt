Here is the fix. Extract the attached resource.zip file into your LabVIEW 2019 folder. 
You can either extract it directly, or copy it first and then extract it. If you copy it first, 
you may want to delete the zip file when finished.

 

When you extract you should get a dialog telling you the destination already has a file named 
"Rename Templates.vi". Choose Replace the file in the destination.

 

The result is you should end up with this file replaced:

\LabVIEW 2019\resource\Framework\Providers\FRCSubsystem\Rename Templates.vi
